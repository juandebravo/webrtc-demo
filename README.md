The goal of this repository is defining a high level overview of WebRTC
and build a simple application to demo it.

Technologies used:

- [Remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/#1): A simple, in-browser, Markdown-driven slideshow tool.
- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/): A free, open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs.
- [Chrome](https://www.google.es/chrome/browser/desktop/): One browser for your computer, phone and tablet
- [CallRoulette](https://github.com/saghul/CallRoulette): A WebRTC demo using Python (asyncio + aiohttp) as the backend
- [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/): An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

[documentation section](http://www.juandebravo.com/webrtc-demo-tid).
