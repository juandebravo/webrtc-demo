# WebRTC & k8s.<br/> Two domains that will conquer the world

---

# Agenda

1. What is WebRTC?
1. What is NOT WebRTC?
1. Why does this talk mention Kubernetes?
1. How to build a P2P video chat
1. How to deploy a P2P video chat in the cloud with ease

---
# What is WebRTC?

---
## Who defines it?

- **W3C**: World Wide Web Consortium
  It defines the APIs needed for JavaScript web applications to
  interact with the browser RTC capabilities.
  e.g. RTCPeerConnection, getUserMedia, etc.

- **IETF**: Internet Engineering Task Force
  It defines the protocols that should be used by the browser
  RTC engine to talk to another WebRTC capable endpoint (either
  another browser or another node).
  e.g. SDP, ICE, FEC, etc.

---
## Capabilities

- Audio communications (1:1 or group)
- Video communications (1:1 or group)
- Data communications (screen share, file transfer, messaging, gaming, etc)

---
## Media
  - Capture (localStream)
  - Transmission
  - Negotiation via Offer/Answer: SDP
    - codecs / codecs parameters
    - media types
    - media multiplexing
    - helpers in RTCPeerConnection to generate them
    - onnegotiationneeded
  - Media path
    NAT
    STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT)
    TURN (Traversal Using Relay around NAT)
    ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)
      - NIC (Network Interface Cards): host candidates
      - STUN: server reflexive candidates
      - TURN: relay candidates
    Trickle ICE
  - Security

---
## Browser native APIs (W3C)

- MediaStreamTrack
- MediaStream
  - each getUserMedia call generates a local MediaStream object
  - each MediaStream instance has a unique identifier
- RTCPeerConnection: set up media and data connection paths between
  two browsers
    - JSEP: JavaScript Session Establishment Protocol
- getUserMedia
- RTCSessionDescription
- RTCIceCandidates

---
## Fine tune the media
- getUserMedia constraints
- SDP munge

---
## Current support

- Browsers 1/2 (Chrome & Firefox)

- Browsers 2/2 (Edge & Safari)

- Native SDKs

---
## WebRTC & ORTC

---

# What is NOT WebRTC?

- Signalling
  * Transport Layer
    - HTTP (polling, long polling, HTTP/2)
    - WebSockets
    - DataChannels
  * Protocol
    - SIP
    - Jingle
    - Proprietary
  *
